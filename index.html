<div class="about">
    <p>Hello, my name is Andrew, and I am currently a student a devCodeCamp and Certified<br> Respiratory Therapist in Alaska.
        The first thing that you may ask is “How did those two career fields come together?”. As a Respiratory Therapist
        on the frontlines of the pandemic I began to see a need for the two to come together as covid affected us all in 
        so many ways. Taking on the stress of the pandemic and seeing the burdens of so many other healthcare workers I 
        decided to see what I can do about it. As a veteran of the military, it was also obvious that many of the stressors
        that myself and fellow coworkers experience are also similar to the traumatic experiences in the battlefield.
         I am passionately dedicated to doing what I can to merge to two fields to benefit the efforts against the pandemic.
        <br> Part of that passion is Full Stack Development, and it was obvious to me that it would only<br> continue to grow and 
        be an integral part of all our lives. Here you will find some of the projects I have worked on and continue to work on. 
        Although my background may be in healthcare, I found a new love in all aspects of web development, and I am excited to 
        be part of the future as the  need for technological advancement only continues to grow. Feel free to contact me with 
        any questions you may have. Thanks for visiting! </p>
